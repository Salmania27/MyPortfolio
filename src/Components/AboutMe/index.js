                Hi, I am  Salmania Jesamine Putri. I was born in Bandung, June 27th 2001. I'm studying IT and I do enjoy it, most aspects of it. 
                But sometimes i feel tired because there is a lot of hard work and I cannot say that I enjoy all of this. 
                But what I really enjoy is to solving problems in the programs and the feeling when I manage to solve the problems. ðŸ’«</p>
